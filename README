README for LuaJIT for devkitPPC 2.1.0-beta3
-------------------------------------------

LuaJIT is a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler for the Lua programming language.

This repo contains some patches that enable LuaJIT to build on devkitPPC-supported platforms, which are currently the Wii and GameCube.
Huge thanks to thenumbernine for his Wii LuaJIT compile script: https://github.com/thenumbernine/wii-luajit/blob/master/luajit.make.wii.sh
